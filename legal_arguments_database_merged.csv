The Tribunal found that the evidence as regards Mr. Chukin's previous possession of Kyrgyz citizenship does not call into question the probity of this prima facie evidence. The Tribunal considered that the termination of Mr. Varenko's Kazakh citizenship on 11 July 2014 demonstrates that, on that date, circumstances existed under Kazakh law to merit such termination. However, given the absence of any evidence of a prior termination of Kazakh citizenship, and given the prima facie evidence that Mr. Varenko did possess Kazakh citizenship on the required dates, the Tribunal concludes that the fact of the later termination of Mr. Varenko's citizenship does not call into question his possession of citizenship on the required dates."

IDS-533,Kim and others v. Uzbekistan,Decision on Jurisdiction,Jurisdiction,Respondent,"Claimants' role in relation to BC and KC is ""passive"" rather than ""active"" and therefore Claimants are not ""investors"".","BIT Art. 1(1), ICSID Convention Art. 25","['investor', 'active', 'passive', 'management']",No,"The Tribunal held that the BIT in this case does not contain a distinction between active and passive investors so as to require investors are ""active"".

IDS-533,Kim and others v.

The word ""made"", both in terms of its ordinary meaning and its use in the past tense, indicates that the test applies at the time the investment is established. It is not a requirement subsequent to the making of the investment. The Tribunal also found that the term ""legislation"" encompasses those normative actions regarded as ""law"" by the Host State's legal system which on the basis of the record in this case is defined by the normative-legal acts set out in Article 5 of the Uzbekistan Law on Normative-Legal Acts. The Tribunal found that the interpretive task is guided by the principle of proportionality. The Tribunal must balance the object of promoting economic relations by providing a stable investment framework with the harsh consequence of denying the application of the BIT in total when the investment is not made in compliance with legislation. The denial of the protections of the BIT is a harsh consequence that is a proportional response only when its application is triggered by noncompliance with a law that results in a compromise of a correspondingly significant interest of the Host State."

Accepting that there exists an act of noncompliance to be considered in concert with Claimants conduct in the context of the alleged violation, as set out at paragraphs 429 to 432 above, the Tribunal by majority finds that such an act of noncompliance does not result in a compromise of an interest of sufficient significance so as to render proportionate the exclusion of the investment from the protections of the BIT."

Moreover, the Tribunal concludes that there is no clear consensus that the scope of the prohibition on bribery in international public policy at present extends beyond those circumstances that aim at the corruption of government officials."

Therefore, the Tribunal found that BNM could not have formally submitted the merger project before SBS without first obtaining the authorization of the proposal of capital increase submitted to SBS."
IDS-375,Renée Rose Levy v. Peru,Dissenting Opinion of Prof. Joaquìn Morales Godoy (Award),Dissenting Opinion,Claimant,"The Claimant alleges a lack of transparency in the PCSF regulations and the failure to notify BNM of a meeting, violating legitimate expectations.","APPRI, Legitimate Expectations","['PCSF', 'transparency', 'notification', 'legitimate expectations', 'emergency decree']",No,The Tribunal found that the meeting was held and the decree was published two days later. The Tribunal found that the invited banks that attended the meeting would not have contributed to the drafting of standards that were approved the next day and published immediately.

This objective context leads me to conclude that the State aggravated BNM's illiquidity situation, caused by rumors, and thus motivated the intervention of the entity."

This measure was effective and stopped bank runs. Therefore I consider that there was an arbitrary omission committed by the regulator against BNM.
IDS-375,Renée Rose Levy v. Peru,Dissenting Opinion of Prof. Joaquìn Morales Godoy (Award),Dissenting Opinion,Claimant,The Claimant argues that the BCR's rejection of BNM's loan application was unjustified and violated legitimate expectations.,"APPRI, Legitimate Expectations","['BCR', 'loan rejection', 'emergency loan', 'monetary regulation', 'legitimate expectations']",Yes,"The Tribunal found that the motivation in the rejection letter was insufficient. As a result, the investor was not aware of the reason why most of the assets of the leased package were not considered by BCR as collateral. Based on the scope of Article 59 (b) of BCR's Organic Law and Article 78 (b) of the BCR's Bylaws which permits any other security acceptable to BCR, BCR's rejection should have stated the grounds."

In line with the foregoing, I see from the Final Report issued by Banco Nuevo on February 28, 2003, that the accounting records of such interests in BNM should have been classified as working capital, rather than savings or deposits. Said records were audited by PwC and made available to SBS, which the majority disavows, granting deference to the evidentiary and testimonial aspects on account of its State capacity."

Peru,Dissenting Opinion of Prof. Joaquìn Morales Godoy (Award),Dissenting Opinion,Claimant,The Claimant argues that the dissolution of BNM was arbitrary.,"APPRI, Fair and Equitable Treatment","['dissolution', 'arbitrary', 'accounting report', 'valuation', 'APPRI']",Yes,"The Tribunal found that arbitrariness is present when SBS states that it relies upon a valuation performed by Arthur Andersen, while the same report of the company says it does not, namely: pursuant to generally accepted Peruvian auditing standards, the procedures applied do not constitute: (i) an audit of the bank's financial statements, (ii) an appraisal of the bank's assets and liabilities, and/or (iii) revision of the bank's internal controls. Therefore, we shall not render any further opinion in that regard. The loss established by A/A is the benchmark used to assert that BNM was not eligible for the PCSF, which constitutes an arbitrary act."

Unlike the majority, I note that Banco de Crédito del Perú, Banco Latino, Interbank and Banco Wiese are all commercial banks operating with both individual and business customers, which means that they are all operating in the same sector. With regard to Banco Latino, I note that it held a small market share and with liquidity ratios below those of BNM according to the SBS's own information as of November 2000 ranking the system's banks by size."

IDS-732,B-Mex and others v. Mexico,Final Award,Award (Final),Respondent,"The Respondent argued that the Claimants should be compensated for only one ""unused license"" rather than two because on the date of valuation they operated a temporary facility in a sixth location (Huixquilucan).",Causation,"['Expansion Projects', 'causation', '2012 Permit', 'Huixquilucan']",No,"The Tribunal accepted the Claimants' evidence that they operated the temporary location in Huixquilucan only because of a proposed legislative bill that would have ""cancelled unused licenses under permits for locations that were not being opened according to the buildout schedule associated with the permit"" and that the goal of the temporary facilities was ""not to risk their cancellation"". A willing buyer looking at the 2012 Permit, which imposed no geographical restrictions, would therefore have assumed that the buyer would be able to close that temporary facility and open a new casino elsewhere."
IDS-732,B-Mex and others v. Mexico,Final Award,Award (Final),Respondent,"The Respondent argued that the taxes owed are a liability that any potential buyer would have discounted from the value of the acquisition in a market transaction and, therefore, it must be discounted from the compensation amount.",Full Reparation,"['tax liability', 'compensation', 'full reparation', 'valuation']",Yes,"The Tribunal agreed that the willing buyer would have negotiated either (i) a price adjustment reflecting the additional tax payment in 2014; or (ii) an indemnity for the amount of that price adjustment (for the scenario where a judicial recourse was pursued but failed, as in fact occurred). In either case, the Claimants would have seen the Mexican Companies' proceeds from the hypothetical sale reduced by the price adjustment. The Tribunal has accordingly reduced the compensation owed the Mexican Companies by MXN$170,475,625."
IDS-732,B-Mex and others v.
