In 2008, the Republic of Kronos, a neighboring state, granted Fenoscadia an exclusive 80-year license to extract lindoro, a rare earth metal, from its territory. The concession agreement permitted Fenoscadia to mine lindoro in Kronos‚Äôs inland regions, and the company began commercial operations shortly thereafter. Lindoro is a valuable resource used in electronics and renewable energy technologies, and Fenoscadia became the sole extractor of lindoro in Kronos.

Over the years, Fenoscadia invested significantly in infrastructure, technology, and labor to support its operations, and the project became a key part of Kronos‚Äôs export economy. However, tensions emerged in 2016 when the government of Kronos issued Presidential Decree No. 242, revoking Fenoscadia‚Äôs mining license and unilaterally terminating the concession. The decree cited environmental and public health concerns, referencing a government-funded scientific study that allegedly linked lindoro mining to contamination of the Rhea River and increased rates of cardiovascular disease and microcephaly among local populations.

The study, however, did not conclusively establish a direct causal link between Fenoscadia‚Äôs operations and the alleged health or environmental harms. Despite this, Kronos proceeded with the revocation, ordered the immediate cessation of lindoro extraction, and confiscated all extracted lindoro stored on site. Fenoscadia contends that it was not afforded due process and that the revocation amounted to an unlawful expropriation of its investment in violation of the Ticadia‚ÄìKronos Bilateral Investment Treaty (‚Äúthe BIT‚Äù).

Arbitration proceedings were subsequently initiated by Fenoscadia against Kronos. In response, Kronos filed a counterclaim, seeking at least USD 150 million in damages for alleged environmental degradation, public health costs, and the expense of purifying contaminated water sources. Fenoscadia disputes both the jurisdiction of the tribunal over the counterclaim and its substantive validity, arguing that its operations were conducted in compliance with Kronos‚Äôs environmental regulations and that the study lacks sufficient scientific basis to support the claimed damages."""
